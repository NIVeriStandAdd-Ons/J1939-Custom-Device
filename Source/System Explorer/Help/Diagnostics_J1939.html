<p class="Body"><strong>J1939 Diagnostics</strong> provides the ability to request and read diagnostic messages (DM) 1 and 2 from any device on the J1939 network.  These messages are used to read the active and previously active diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) respectively.  This section also provides the ability to send DM 3 and 11.  These messages are used to to clear previously active and active DTCs respectively.</p>
<h2>Common Diagnostic Channels</h2>
<h3>Address to Query</h3>
<p class="Body">This channel sets which J1939 device to address when sending a diagnostic message.  The value -1 is used to address all devices on the J1939 bus.</p>
<h3>Diagnostic Command</h3>
<p class="Body">This channel sets which diagnostic message to send.  Accepted values are as follows:</p>
  <p>0 - Idle
  <p>1 - Get all J1939 Device Addresses
  <p>2 - Verify DTC
  <p>3 - Clear DTCs
  <p>4 - Clear Diagnostic Command Status
  <p>5 - Clear Diagnostic Error Code</p>
<p class="Body">Commands are latched and executed on value change.  Once the execution of a command has started, <strong>Diagnostic Command Status</strong> will be set to 0 (false) until the execution is finished, at which point it will be set to 1 (true).  Note: You must executed the <strong>Get all J1939 Device Addresses</strong> command before executing the <strong>Verify DTC</strong> or <strong>Clear DTCs</strong> commands.</p>
<h3>Diagnostic Command Status</h3>
<p class="Body">This channel indicates the status of the diagnostic command engine.  When the channel is 0 (false), the engine is active.  When the channel is 1 (true), the command engine has finished executing the latest command.  This channel can then be polled after setting the <strong>Diagnostic Command</strong> to ensure the returned data is valid.  The <strong>Clear Diagnostic Command Status</strong> command sets this channel to 0.</p>
<h3>Diagnostic Error Code</h3>
<p class="Body">This channel shows the error status from the diagnostic command engine.  The <strong>Clear Diagnostic Error Code</strong> command sets this channel to 0.</p>
